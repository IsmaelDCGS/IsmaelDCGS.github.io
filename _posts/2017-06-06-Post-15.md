Today I did the final conditionals and control flow exercise which  combined everything we had learnt about over the course: Comparators, conditional statements, boolean. After I had done this we started a course on a pyg latin translator.Pyg latin is just a code, where you add "ay" to the beginning of a word and move the first letter to the end, and I had to make a translator for this language. The course started off by catching up on the simple basics, like printing a word, inputs and variables. I then went over some stuff from conditional and control flow that we had just done, like 'if', ‘and’ and ‘or’. I had started the code, so the person has to input the word, and the program will translate it.
