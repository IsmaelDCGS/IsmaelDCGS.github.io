Today we, in the first lesson of the new school year, we started a new topic which was google sheets. These are used to create spreadsheets to show information for you and google sheets is very useful, because it can find out the averages, the sum and the count of a set of numbers, along with other things. I'm very new to it so I have no idea how to use some stuff and what some stuff means, but iâ€™m learning.
