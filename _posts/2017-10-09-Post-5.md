This week we worked out how much costs a company would earn and then used spreadsheets to work out the cost. I worked out the cost of the salaries for everyone in the companies. You had to input two things, the job and the hours worked and then it work out how much money they would earn. I did this by making the box where you input the job. It recognises the job and how much their salary is per hour, e.g. janitor earns 8/hour, then it multiplies the money per hour by how many hours they worked to find the salary.
