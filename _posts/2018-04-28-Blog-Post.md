This week we carried on using python in order to make a quiz that tells something about you after you answer a few questions about a topic. You can use maths to help by making each answer worth a number then give the reader something at the end based on the sum of the answers.Buzzfeed use this and we tried out some examples on  buzzfeed to see what to put in our own. The problem with buzzfeed ones is that they usually don't give you anything that specially mentions one of your answers, so the user does not feel special.
