    <td>I should be quick from my last lesson so i arrive on time.
I need to focus more on the work and not talk as much
I shouldn't use the hint so much so I can solve it myself and actually learn more instead of having the work done for me. 
Take notes on what happens in the lesson so I can use it in the lesson.</td>
