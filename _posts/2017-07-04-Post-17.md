This lesson i started the next part of functions and using them i would determine how much a holiday would cost, e.g flights, hotels, how much your wage is and transportation. Finally we took some other factors into account (spending money) and. Then we had created a function that could work out how much a trip would cost taking into account all the different factors for example: Los angeles for 5 days with 600 spending money. Once I had done that I started a new course, lists. Lists are a datatype that you can use to store different pieces of information, like a sequence, under one variable. Also this lesson I earned another badge, which was 100 exercises done.
