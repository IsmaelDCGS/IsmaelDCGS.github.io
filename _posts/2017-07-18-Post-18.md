This lesson i finished the python lists and dictionaries exercise, and then started the next one, which was to manage a functioning supermarket. The first exercise was to recap all the things we had learnt so we can re apply  in our supermarket code. I did this quite easily, because I already knew most of the stuff in this exercise. Then i started the next exercise,  which was just the normal stuff you do when in charge of a store, e.g keeping a list of stock and making prices.
