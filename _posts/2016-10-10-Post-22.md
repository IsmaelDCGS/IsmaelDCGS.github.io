    <td>This week we had 3 assessments in the handbook we did together, without going back to get help. The first test was not very hard, the second was pretty hard and the last was very hard, but it was all stuff we had done before and working together we persevered through it.

  <tr>
    <td>I should probably check my work before I run it a few times, because in coding there is a lot you must get exactly right before you run the script. Also a lot of words that should be capitals weren't in my script.  </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time I should go back and check through my assessments to make sure every word I use is perfect and precise. Also I need to re do a lot of my work because we only have a memory stick now when we should have had it weeks ago.</td>
