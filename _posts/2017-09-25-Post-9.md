This week we continued google sheets and worked on the next step, discounts. These were much more complicated then I would have thought and involved a involved a lot of steps. The first one was to make a table of Codes which would redeem specific discounts, eg AC would get 15% off or AX would get 20% off.. Then you make a place for the user to input the code, e.g AX53553 make a function to isolate the first two letters, AX, which would give a 20% discount. You can make a function to recognise every code and every discount it gives by using the IF function. Now you just subtract the product of the subtotal of all the items and the discount percentage, giving you the new price.
