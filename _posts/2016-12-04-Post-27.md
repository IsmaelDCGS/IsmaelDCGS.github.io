    <td>This week wasn't very different from usual, we had a chat about blogs,set up fuezbox, coded and finished but this week I had a trick up my sleeve. Last week we had done computational thinking from last week, and this week I had a chance to use it. Using pattern recognition I used the patterns I already new to help me and using decomposition and abstract I broke the code into easier bits to understand and got rid of unimportant info. Now i will use these to work quicker.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I need to try and work faster and more efficiently than what I am doing right now and pick up stuff from the book, so i donâ€™t get stuck when it becomes tough. Also I need to try and make computational thinking a normal thought process that goes through my head so I slowly do it without thinking about it. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will work faster and more efficiently, by not getting hung up on programs i have already finished. Also I should pick things up from the book and use computational thinking whenever i can no matter what it is, so it can become a normal thought process in my head, as this will help me a lot. </td>
