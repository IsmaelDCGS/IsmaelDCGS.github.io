    <td>Decomposition Breaking up a problem into smaller pieces
Pattern Recognition Finding Patterns to solve complex problems quicker
Abstract Getting rid of the unimportant information in a problem
Algorithm Logical instructions for a computer to follow.</td>

    <td>Sometimes I just start from scratch when I'm solving a problem, instead of using the patterns I already know. I don't break up the problem or remove things that aren't important.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will use computional thinking to solve complex problems more efficiently, for example if I had to bake a cake i would find instructions, break it down into parts that are easier to understand, get rid of the unimportant details and use what I learnt to help me bake other cakes.</td>
