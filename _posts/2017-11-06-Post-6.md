In the first week of half term we started a new topic, cryptography, and made a new sheets. Cryptography is a way of sending data in a particular way, so only the people you want to can read it. In our sheets we made a shift cypher that could translate anything you type into a code. We did this by applying the stuff we learnt last half-term, and new stuff like "concatenate". First I made a table showing the alphabet and what each letter translates to, and then I used vlookup to recognise that letter and code it. I made the cypher also be able to translate code back to english and finally added a place that shows the results and changes when the results change, using concatenate.
