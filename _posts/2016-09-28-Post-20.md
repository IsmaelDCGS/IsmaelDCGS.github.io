    <td>The way we learnt was by reading the handbook and coding. We had to take turns doing reading and practising on the computer. Sometimes we discussed what it said in the handbook, what it meant and how to do it. This helped us to understand the work better.

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>I spent too long doing the same thing in the handbook and playing around with it for too long. This probably made me do less work and limited my working. I should probably move on to the next activity quicker. Also some times I read through the handbook too quickly and miss some instructions which messed up my coding.
