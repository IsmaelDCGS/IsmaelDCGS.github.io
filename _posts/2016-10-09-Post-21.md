    <td>This week we began to incorporate variables into our coding. We had to be precise in our coding because when we wrote a variable twice they had to be EXACTLY the same or the computer would not recognise the variable and say that when we tried to run our program. By the end we could have a conversation with our computer about our favourite hobbies and names.

    <td>I wasn't precise and careful enough when coding, and I got stuck on stuff we had already done because I wasn’t reading everything on the pages and just going ahead.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I should be more precise and careful to make sure my variables are correct every time. Also I should read the handbook more about why you put stuff into the code so that I don’t have to go back and read the handbook again because I found myself stuck and confused on stuff we had already done.</td>
