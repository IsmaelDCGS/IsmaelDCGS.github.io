 In this lesson I continued my work on     codecademy python. Since i did a lot of work last lesson i only had to do a few exercises before i had a fully functioning supermarket. Then i started the next exercise,which was 'The student becomes the teacher'. For this we had to use everything we had learnt over the courses. For the first exercises we used lists and dictionaries to make timetables and scores. Then we just made a record of all the students grades. After doing this i had finished the beginning of the exercise.
