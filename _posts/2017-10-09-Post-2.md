Today we worked on spreadsheets again and used ranges to sort through stock. They would change colour to alert if there is too much or too little stock. Also we used a profit target which would change all the prices to fit it, e.g if you buy some bananas for 1 pound it would sell for 1.22 if the profit target was 22%. Next we used the VLOOKUP function to find codes from the stock sheet and show the price when you typed in the code.
