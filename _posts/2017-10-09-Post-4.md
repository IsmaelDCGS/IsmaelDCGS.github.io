This lesson we continued working on discount codes but instead of using the first 2 letters to work out the code we used specific codes from a different spreadsheet. The user inputted them and the VLOOKUP tool would look up the code from the spreadsheet and apply the discount. This lesson we did without much help so we used perseverance and applied previous knowledge to work it out.
