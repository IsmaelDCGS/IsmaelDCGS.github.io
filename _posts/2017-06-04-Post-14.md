This week we learnt some boolean operators. Some of these include "and", “or”, “not”. We also learnt control flow, which gives you the ability to choose an outcome depending on what else is happening in the program. Comparators are the simplest aspect of control flow. These are ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=. Comparators check if a value is equal to, greater than or less than another value. You have to be careful and precise because = is used when assigning a value to a variable whereas == is used to show 2 values are equal. This is the hardest part of python (so far) so I used the glossary, Q n A forum and hint every time I could, to make suse I could do it  every time.
