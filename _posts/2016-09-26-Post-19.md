    <td>To learn how to code with Fuze Box we learnt from a book called "get with the program". Me and my partner both worked together to create some cool programs that the computer would run for us. The best way for us to learn was to take shifts of reading the book and typing so we both got experience of learning the coding and practising it.

  <tr>
    <td>I need to work on keeping focused on the target and not going off course and talking about or doing other things. Also I should probably set up quicker and not waste time at the beginning, however overall I think me and my partner did well to set up before a lot of the group, who spent ages turning on the Fuze Box and other things.</td>

    <td>Next time i should focus more on the target and try to make sure I have completed it before
I started trying out new things and playing around with the coding.</td>
