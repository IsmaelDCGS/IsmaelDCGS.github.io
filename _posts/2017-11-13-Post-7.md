In the second week of this half-term we carried on doing cryptography and I tried to use iserror to make the translator recognise blanks instead of just saying ERROR. Also I used =len to recognise the length of a translation, which will come in useful later on. Next I used left and right to breakout the translation into different letters. I did this by using the left tool to find the furthest left letter and took away a certain number of letters on the right to leave you with just that letter, e.g =LEFT(RIGHT($G$11,$I$11-G16)), g11 is where the translation is stored, I11 is the length of the translation and g16 is the number of the letter in the word.
