This week we continued the python coding in code academy. It got a lot harder than before but i managed to get a badge.We covered many different topics variables and string, and we learnt to link them together. Sometimes if me and the people sitting around me stuck on one stage we would help each other, and this was the best way to get through each course and learn. The further i got, the less questions had hints so they got much harder than last week, and i didn't get as much done.
