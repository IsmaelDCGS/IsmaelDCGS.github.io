    <td>We worked together to complete all the tasks we tried and each had different roles that we swapped every ten minutes. One was coding, the other was reading the handbook and the final person was writing notes for our blog. Also we knew if what we were doing was right because if your coding is correct because the website is colour coded, so if it works the coding will go orange.

    <td>There were many mistakes in my coding that I only realised were there when I ran the blog, so I should check the colour coding system before I run the blog.
